This short guide describes the installation of both puppet master and agent.

Puppet is installed on Ubuntu 12.04 / 10 under /usr/share/puppet/.


Setup for the server:


1. Edit /etc/puppet/puppet.conf and add the following lines

	certname = <your server name>
	server =   <your server name>  
	
	
	
  report = store, http                                    	
  certname = flakedev.no-ip.org                           	
  dns_alt_names = flakedev.no-ip.org                      	
  reporturl = http://flakedev.no-ip.org:3000/report/upload	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
2. Start the server:

	 sudo puppet master --verbose --logdest console
		

Setup for the client (assuming Ubuntu 12.04 release):

1. Install packages from Puppetlabs

sudo apt-get install wget
wget http://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-precise.deb
sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-precise.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install puppet

2. Edit /etc/puppet/puppet.conf and add the following lines

	certname = <your server name>
	server =   <your server name>  

[agent]         
  report = true;
	
	
	
	
Enable communications between client and server:


1. Start the client and first ensure, that the client can communicate with the server

sudo  puppet agent --test --waitforcert 30 -v --server <your server name>  --certname <name of your client>

2. On the server check, if the certificate request arrived: 

sudo puppet cert list

3. Sign the client request:
  
sudo puppet cert --sign <client>

Dont forget the SUDO, otherwise the system only gives you back an empty list.

4. Edit the file fileserver.conf on the server to be able to server files:

Add

[honeypot]
    path /data/honeypot
    allow *
   
to add a mountpoint honeypot, which points to /data/honeypot.   
    
Please note that this file ("fileserver.conf") does not necessarily exists.

5. Start the client

sudo  puppet agent --no-daemonize --logdest console --server <your server name>


                                
                                
                                
                                sudo -u puppet-dashboard ./script/server -e production
