This short guide describe


Setup for the server:


1. Edit /etc/puppet/puppet.conf and add the following lines

	certname = <your server name>
	server =   <your server name>
	
2. Start the server:

	 sudo puppet master --verbose --logdest console
		

Setup for the client (assuming Ubuntu 12.04 release):

1. Install packages from Puppetlabs

sudo apt-get install wget
wget http://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-precise.deb
sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-precise.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install puppet

2. Edit /etc/puppet/puppet.conf and add the following lines

	certname = <your server name>
	server =   <your server name>
	
	
Enable communications between client and server:


1. Start the client and first ensure, that the client can communicate with the server

sudo  puppet agent --test --waitforcert 30 -v --server <your server name>

2. On the server check, if the certificate request arrived: 

sudo puppet cert list

3. Sign the client request:
  
sudo puppet cert --sign <client>

Dont forget the SUDO, otherwise the system only gives you back an empty list.

4. Edit the file fileserver.conf on the server to be able to server files:

Add

[honeypot]
    path /data/honeypot
    allow *
   
to add a mountpoint honeypot, which points to /data/honeypot.   
    
Please note that this file ("fileserver.conf") does not necessarily exists.

5. Start the client

sudo  puppet agent --no-daemonize --logdest console --server <your server name>
